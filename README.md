# Oculon - AI-Powered Traffic Incident Detection System

## 🎯 Project Overview

Oculon is an AI-powered real-time traffic incident detection system that analyzes live camera feeds from roads or highways, detects accidents or emergencies, and automatically alerts nearby hospitals, police stations, and emergency responders.

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Frontend**: React + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: Flask + Python
- **AI Models**: YOLOv8 (object detection) + Google Gemini VLM (semantic understanding)
- **Cloud Services**: AWS S3, SNS, Lambda, DynamoDB
- **Database**: AWS DynamoDB for alert logs and metadata

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Python 3.9+
- AWS Account with S3, SNS, Lambda, DynamoDB access
- Google Gemini API key

### Environment Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your API keys
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   # Frontend
   cd frontend
   npm install
   
   # Backend
   cd ../backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Application

1. Start the backend:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python app.py
   ```

2. Start the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser

4. Or: The app is being hosted live on https://oculon-one.vercel.app/ too!
